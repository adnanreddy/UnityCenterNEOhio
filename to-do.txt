TO-DO:
add more information about Islam and what we believe
	that will need it's own subpage as well
	link to read quran
rip/add pictures
need to broaden the "about" section after getting more information from people
add SEO
resources offered by the masjid? actually, this I don't know myself...

need to make an actual separate CSS so that it can be imported to each page
need to do similar for header/footer, so only <main> changes from page to page
need to get rid of the <base> part if possible

honestly, things aren't actually so bad right now, wouldn't be the worst to chane things manually, may be more effort to centralize than to just remember to change on each page

I don't like the church website where everything's in rounded boxes, there's another example that goes overboard with images
however do need to integrate more images into the website, just tastefully...
some of these websites just have too much going on...
	This one is more tasteful: https://bacc.cc/ (it's Bay Area, they know how to do tech)
Not sure why I didn't look at masjids first:
	https://iccicenter.org/ this seems like a bit too busy, but it's VERY consistent, they have their stuff together
	Okay let's not be like NICC lol
	ICC actually isn't bad, https://www.iccleveland.org/, but we can be a little more consistent and restrained than that, overall information is quite solid, actually good example to follow
	https://mecca.net/ their header is lowkey cancer but actually the rest of the site is very solid, also a good example

masjid leadership sort of added to front page, moving adding a completely separate page to lower priority
